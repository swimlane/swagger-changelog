[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/swagger-changelog.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/swagger-changelog)

Generate a changelog between two versions of a swagger spec

# Install
`npm install -g swagger-changelog`

# Usage
`swagger-changelog [options] <path/to/spec1> <path/to/spec2>`

## Options
```
-h, --help          output usage information
-V, --version       output the version number
-e, --endpoint <n>  Endpoint Threshold, 0-1.0 (Default 0.85, higher means closer)
-p, --param <n>     Param Threshold, 0-1.0 (Default 0.75, higher means closer)
```

## Distance Thresholds
The Endpoint and Param thresholds are the minimum value for the Damerau - Levenshtein comparison ratio. It scores from 0-1 how similar the two words are.

## Example
```
$ swagger-changelog src/tests/specs/petstore.1.json src/tests/specs/petstore.1.1.json
Changes: /pet (put) - Method added
Renamed: Path '/pet/findByStatus' renamed to '/pet/findByStatii'
Renamed: Path '/pet/findByTags' renamed to '/pet/findByTag'
Renamed: /pet/{petId} (get) - Param 'petId' renamed to 'petIdz'
```

# API Usage
```
const changelog = require(swagger-changelog).changelog;

changelog('path/to/spec1', 'path/to/spec2', config)
  .then((log) => {
    console.log(log.paragraph);
  });
```
